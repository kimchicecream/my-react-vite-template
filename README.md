# My React Vite Template

This repo creates a new React app to be used as a baseline template in future React projects. It also demonstrates the use of technologies like Vite and Lint.

## How to clone

```plaintext
npx tiged kimichicecream/my-react-vite-template#main my-react-vite-template
```

Copy and paste the command above into the directory where you want to clone this repo. Press enter and wait for the clone to complete. You can then `cd` into the cloned repo and then use the command `code .` to open the cloned repo in VSCode (assuming you have that cmd set up). Voila. You can now use this repo however you'd like.

## How to install dependencies

Before doing anything, you would want to install all proper dependencies for the application to work properly. To begin, make sure you are at the root level of the cloned repo. In this case, you would have to `cd` into the **my-react-vite-template** file. Once you verify that you are at the root level, run the following command:

```plaintext
npm install
```

After installation has completed, you can then start the app by running the following command:
```plaintext
npm run dev
```

## Make it your own

Assuming you want to make this repo your own and add personal touches or rename certain things to match the style of the project you are working on, you should entertain the following steps to accomplish this.

Firstly, to change the README title, click on the **README.md** file at the root directory. This should open up the README. Change the title (the first line of the README with a single '#') and anything else you deem necessary to fit your project.

Secondly, navigate to **index.html**. This file should also be in your root directory. Find the only `<title>` element and replace the inner text `My Template` to whatever you want that fits your project.

Lastly, navigate to the **package.json** file in the root directory. The first key named `"name"` has a value of `"my-react-vite-template"`. Change this value to whatever you want that fits your project.

You have now customized the project to fit your own project needs.
